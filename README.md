# Decision tree regression
Decision tree regression leverages the structure of decision trees for a specific task: predicting continuous values. Imagine a branching pathway where each decision you make refines the predicted value you're looking for. That's the core idea behind decision tree regression – it uses a tree-like model to analyze data and arrive at a predicted value for a continuous target variable.

The structure starts with a root node, similar to classification trees. This node represents the initial feature used to split the data. Each branch stemming from the root signifies a possible value range for that feature. The branches further divide based on additional features of the data.

Let's say you're predicting house prices. The root node might ask "Is the square footage above 2000?" If yes, one branch might lead to "Is the location suburban?" and so on. Following these branches, you eventually reach leaf nodes – the final destinations. These nodes contain the predicted value, like an estimated house price range in our example.

But how does the tree actually learn to predict these values? During training, the algorithm analyzes a dataset and identifies the most significant feature (like square footage in house price prediction) to split the data into groups. This process continues down each branch, aiming to create groups of data points in the leaf nodes with similar target values (house prices in this case). The algorithm stops when a pre-defined criterion is met, like reaching a desired level of accuracy or data similarity within the groups.

Here's what makes decision tree regression distinct from standard decision trees:

Splitting Metric: Instead of using metrics like Gini impurity (common in classification trees), decision tree regression uses a least squares approach to find the split that minimizes the squared difference between the actual target values and the average value in each branch.
Leaf Nodes: Leaf nodes in regression trees hold continuous values (predicted house prices) instead of discrete class labels (rainy/sunny).
Decision trees are prized for their interpretability. By tracing the branches, we can understand the features that influence the final prediction. However, they can be susceptible to overfitting if not carefully grown (too many branches) and might struggle with complex relationships between features.

In essence, decision tree regression offers a clear and interpretable way to predict continuous values by segmenting data based on a series of branching questions and arriving at a predicted value at the end of the path.
